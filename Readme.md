This is a very initial stage client library for [https://newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org).

The current implementation is a 1:1 port of the C# official library:

More work is needed to make it more robust and more Java idiomatic.

You need an API key to use the API - this is a unique key that identifies your requests. They're free for development, open-source, and non-commercial use. You can get one here: [https://newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org).
